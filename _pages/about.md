I am a PhD student at the National University of Singapore, co-supervised by <a href='https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html'> Dr. Bryan Low </a> and <a href='https://haroldsoh.com'> Dr. Harold Soh </a>. I am interested in teaching AI agents and robots precisely what to do/achieve to avoid any unexpected consequences. In particular, I design algorithms that enable agents to learn their purpose from watching demonstrations from experts.

Before my PhD, I worked as a Research Engineer at the UNiCEN lab at Singapore Management University (SMU), modelling supply and demand patterns of taxis in Singapore. Before that, I was at ABB Private Limited as a Process Automation Engineer and later as a Section Manager overseeing a team of product specialists in charge of customers from Asia, Australia and New Zealand. For details about my background and research, please take a look at my [curriculum vitae](/cv/) and my <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xzxfdkoAAAAJ'> Google Scholar </a> page.
