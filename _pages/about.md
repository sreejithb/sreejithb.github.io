Hello! I am Sreejith. 

I am a Ph.D. student at the National University of Singapore under Dr. Bryan Low and Dr. Harold Soh. I am interested in how one can precisely instruct an AI agent/robot on what to do or achieve without any unexpected consequences.

Research: My general research interest lies in Learning from Demonstrations, Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. I am also interested in Causal Inference and incorporating sociental concerns such as fairness to algorithmic decision making. In my projects, I have utilized popular techniques such as Bayesian optimization, Gaussian Process, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, etc. For details about my background and research, please take a look at my curriculum vitae and my google scholar page.

Previously: Perhaps a bit untypical of a Ph.D. student, I worked in the industry for around 8 years before deciding to do my Ph.D. I started my career in the process automation section at ABB Private Limited, Singapore, where I was a Section Manager at the After Sales Support. I headed a team of 5 specialist in charge of customers from Asia, Australia and New Zealand. I was also an Expert Trainer for ABB products and travelled to many parts of the world to conduct product trainings. Despite a great career, I decided that my calling is in AI research and eventually switched to a Research Engineer position at the UNiCEN lab at the Singapore Management University (SMU). At SMU, I worked on the problem of predicting taxi demands and supply at various hotspots in Singapore.
