<p>Hitec Robonova robots are essentially toy robots with limited programming capabilities. So when Singapore Discovery Center approached my undergraduate Final Year Project team for a robotics showcase involving multiple robots, we took it as a challenge to use Robonova robots and push them to their limits. We had to retrofit the robots with multiple sensors and communication devices such as bluetooth antennae. We then implemented a synchronization protocol where the robots communicate with a server at fixed time periods to synchronize their dance moves with the music. The showcase was open to the public in 2008 and attracted the attention of the public and media alike.</p>
